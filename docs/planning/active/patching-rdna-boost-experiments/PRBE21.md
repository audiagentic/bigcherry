# Fold SSM conv_input concat into qkv mmvq; rpb=2 for small-K MoE

## Description

SSM conv-input folding remains an unmaterialized candidate requiring dependency audit, port, and isolated SSM/Mamba qualification.

## Steps

1. Implement the still-valid future scope.
2. Run the stated acceptance and evidence gates.
3. Preserve predecessor provenance and record successor evidence under this ID.

## Detailed Solution & Technical Design

Capability owner: patching

Split assessment: One independent boundary; Build/Run support is a dependency.

Overlap assessment: No duplicate boundary found; related items are prerequisites or adjacent evidence.

## Code Samples & Guidance



## Files

successor-specs/patching-rdna-boost-experiments-rd27.md

## Validation

Historical evidence and constraints: Preserve frozen notes/reviews/evidence on predecessor; IDs: none extracted.

Active dependencies: Frozen dependencies: RD09,RD24.

Reference handling: Rewrite forward references (3); preserve historical references (0) on predecessor.

## Effort & Risk



## Standards

Capability rebaseline v3 REVIEW_PROTOCOL.md; preserve historical provenance.

## Acceptance Criteria

Close the recorded gap and pass the frozen scope's stated implementation, correctness, performance, or evidence gate.

## Notes
